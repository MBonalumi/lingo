# Lingo

In this repo, I apply data science tecniques, such as entropy minimization, to analyze the Zingarelli italian vocabulary (see [here](https://github.com/pazqo/scalaWords/) or [here](https://github.com/napolux/paroleitaliane)).

The goal is to assess an optimal strategy to pursue in the popular italian tv show "Lingo".

Here we tackle one of the most played game in the tv show, in which, similarly to wordle,
partecipants are presented with an unknown word of length 5 to 15, and given the initial letter,
they must guess the correct word.
When a word is submitted, correct letters will be highlighted in yellow, and correct letters in the correct position will be highlighted in green.
