# Lingo

In this report, I apply the data science technique entropy maximization to analyze an Italian vocabulary to guess a word given its length and initial letter with the fewest guesses.

The goal is to assess an optimal strategy to apply to the popular italian tv show "Lingo".

Here we build a solver one of the most played game in the tv show, in which, similarly to wordle,
partecipants are presented with an unknown word of length 5 to 15, and given the initial letter,
they must guess the correct word.
When a word is submitted, correct letters will be highlighted in green if they stand in the correct position, and in yellow if they are misplaced.
